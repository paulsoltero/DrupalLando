Drupal is an open source content management platform supporting a variety of
websites ranging from personal weblogs to large community-driven websites. For
more information, visit the Drupal website, [Drupal.org][Drupal.org], and join
the [Drupal community][Drupal community].

## Contributing

Drupal is developed on [Drupal.org][Drupal.org], the home of the international
Drupal community since 2001!

[Drupal.org][Drupal.org] hosts Drupal's [GitLab repository][GitLab repository],
its [issue queue][issue queue], and its [documentation][documentation]. Before
you start working on code, be sure to search the [issue queue][issue queue] and
create an issue if your aren't able to find an existing issue.

Every issue on Drupal.org automatically creates a new community-accessible fork
that you can contribute to. Learn more about the code contribution process on
the [Issue forks & merge requests page][issue forks].

## Usage

For a brief introduction, see [USAGE.txt](/core/USAGE.txt). You can also find
guides, API references, and more by visiting Drupal's [documentation
page][documentation].

You can quickly extend Drupal's core feature set by installing any of its
[thousands of free and open source modules][modules]. With Drupal and its
module ecosystem, you can often build most or all of what your project needs
before writing a single line of code.

## Changelog

Drupal keeps detailed [change records][changelog]. You can search Drupal's
changes for a record of every notable breaking change and new feature since
2011.

## Security

For a list of security announcements, see the [Security advisories
page][Security advisories] (available as [an RSS feed][security RSS]). This
page also describes how to subscribe to these announcements via email.

For information about the Drupal security process, or to find out how to report
a potential security issue to the Drupal security team, see the [Security team
page][security team].
